**Deliverable Status:** working  
**Deliverable Number:** D4.1  
**Deliverable Due Month:** M2  
**Deliverable WP Number**: 4   
**Deliverable File**:   
**Executive Summary**:

The final set of activities will depend on the cost of each, co-funding with other activities, timeliness according to results, and acceptance of application in some events. The list of potential activities:

Dissemination in topic related industry meetings \(electronics sector, RReuse.org, zerowasteeurope. eu, [IERC-2018](http://www.icm.ch/ierc-2018)/2019, ereuseconference.com USA in October, Smart City EXPO Barcelona \(Nov 2019\), Mobile World Congress 2018, Conference Social Enterprise in a Circular Economy RREUSE \(2019\), recycling conference\), training events \(national reuse and repair events\), related conferences \(academic such as ACM Limits, International Conference ICT for Sustainability ICT4S, ICT4D\), industrial such as\), and TagItSmart or eReuse related events \(e.g. eeb.org, rreuse.org, therestartproject.org and procomuns.net\), research papers in publications related to sustainability \(ACM/IEEE\), preparation of a video, posters and interactive demos \(both in eReuse topic areas, and as part of TagItSmart\) to have an impact through industrial, scientific and domain specific magazines, standard bodies \(about data formats\), alliances \(circular economy, sustainability, digital devices\). Participation in TagItSmart! dissemination and training events. Presentation of project results at events organized by the European Commission \(e.g. European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform\) and by consortia of related projects, as well as any other relevant events in the fields touched by TagItSmart!. Contribution to enlarging the TagItSmart! and eReuse.org repositories of dissemination materials.

However, we believe a bigger impact can be achieved indirectly, through established organizations we collaborate with such as the RReuse.org \(it represents social enterprises active in re-use, repair and recycling, working for the EU and national governments to move from promoting just recycling and waste management to putting secondhand first\), Zero Waste Europe \(a network of European municipalities that have openly committed to the goal of continuously reducing waste generation that involves reuse too\), Electronics Watch \(an independent monitoring organisation that assists public sector buyers to meet their responsibility to protect the labour rights of workers in their global electronics supply chains\), Ammbr \(a global foundation and company providing wireless mesh networks built on blockchain, including asset management of digital devices\). These established European organizations monitor and have influence in public policies, NGOs, civil society organizations in this sector, commercial services, and also in public procurement processes that can promote our proposals in dissemination, training events, and including clauses in policies and public procurement contracts.
