**Executive Summary**:



## Project core idea

Digital devices, also referred as electric and electronic equipment \(EEE\), are relevant examples of "slow moving" circular goods \(SMCG\) that, from a circular economy perspective, can have a long usable life. The longer the better for the economy and the environment because increase lifecycle impacts on reducing TCO, increase waste prevention, used products are affordable for low income sectors, and product as a service approach may generate 3-4 more turnover than original purchase with local services including repairs, servicing, diagnostics, technical support, installation and warranty.

The core idea is the development of the “circular economy” use case for SMCG that are reusable, repairable, upgradeable, with internal replaceable parts. After repair and testing by authorized agents, refurbished products go back to the supply chain. The main impact comes from the definition of a key use case for circular economy of SMCG, the extension of the TIS platform to cover this use case, and the development and piloting of business models and solutions for this sector with a large and growing business need, and public interest.

## **What  problem exists and you are trying to solve**

1. How to ensure to device donors the chain of custody from origin \(ITAD\), during multiple cycles of reuse and until final recycling at component level \(Term "Chain of custody" of eReuse License\)?
2. How to ensure the correct application of the waste hierarchy \(Circular Economy\) in such a way that only are recycled products with low use value and without demand \(Term "Value in Chain" of eReuse License\)?
3. How to ensure consumers of used products that purchase properly refurbished products with right to repair permission, maximum selling price in the case of subsidised products and an established take-back collection process \(Term "Right to Repair", "Cost Based Price", ""\)?
4. How to avoid leakage by preventing the export of electronic waste or unauthorized agents have made the preparation for reuse?

## **Solution/product/service to solve it**

DeviceTag.io is a service provided by Pangea, based on eReuse.org components, that offers a platform agnostic and open-source traceability solutions for managing reusing and ensuring recycling of digital devices -such as phones or computers. The service tags each device and tracks devices throughout their full life-span, down to component level, keeping track of their way through other organizations, locations, and changes in their components. This service assist in dealing with each device by:

1. Collects device component characteristics and status, creating a non-modifiable and auditable document that contains: hardware characteristics, operating status, component tests and benchmarks, visual picture _\(under dev.\)_, aesthetic score \(machine learning\) _\(under dev.\)_ , usage value score \(community consensus algorithm\); 
2. Certifying improvements done such as removed/added components, reliably erasing its data and reinstalling the OS, 
3. Managing and sharing devices using a web inventory with a url linked to products storing its certifications \(status, reburbishment process, optimal/subsidized price, warranty, preparation for reuse,..\), 
4. Maintain and online repository subscribed to IOT services about the status and usage of devices \(faults, hours of use, collecting location, conversion to waste, etc.\).. 

## **Main innovation**

The DeviceTag.io is creating core circular business service and data for ITAD/refurbishers/retailers/recyclers and IT maintenance companies responsible for extending the lifespan of devices in use. Everything developed by DeviceTag.io is shared with the eReuse.org community and our service implements the ereuse.org protocol that certifies refurbishment \(and preparation for reuse\) process, chain of custody \(transfers\), circularity performance \(waste hierarchy aplication by storing value of use in the recycling process\). This is protecting consumers of buying/selling non-functional or non-reparable digital devices, boosting confidence between businesses to exchange certified data about the digital devices they want to exchange, making product-as-a-service business more viable and certifying non **premature recycling** of circular economy platforms and business.
