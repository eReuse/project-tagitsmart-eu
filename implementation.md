# Implementation

## Description of the work plan including the project duration

The work plan is structured in one work package for each type of task: 1. Management of the project and pilot, 2. Software, system, process development and TIS integration, 3. Pilot implementation, and 4. Dissemination and exploitation. All the tasks are performed by the only participant.

| **Persons/month per participant:** | 9.2 |

| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Run pilot experiment with partners and customers for an evaluation \(technical and commercial\) of the smart tags, software tools and services, in terms of performance, scalability, and contribute to refine the tags, software system and processes. |
| Implement and evaluate the feasibility, time, cost, adverse events, and variability of the pilot, and improvements for the scaling of the business proposal with smart tags, and market development roadmap of the use case. Validate and evaluate the adoption of the TIS platform. |

| **Description of work** |
| :--- |

| WP3.2 Business process definition and design: service modes, strategy and progress indicators \(KPI\); pricing definition, partnerships; define proof of concept \(POC\) for vendor business roles; define Marketing KPI indicators. |
| WP3.3 Iterative training and support to pilot participants on use case model, circular processes, software and services released in WP2. |
| WP3.4 Quality control of eReuse+TIS services and followup of refurbished devices in the circuit along its lifecycle. |
| WP3.5 Definition and monitoring of pilot KPI and data collection for evaluation. |
| WP3.6 Resolve basic service issues and transfer high-level incidents to WP2. |
| WP3.7 Evaluate user acceptance of TIS platform |
| WP3.8 Market test. Measure interests of the POC and results from a customer sample. |
| WP3.9 During the pilot: identify the value of customer service; revision of pricing; monitoring of KPI about the pilot, circular economy, social impact; market test and evaluation. |
| WP3.10 Elaborate evaluation results for exploitation \(markets, business model, expansion\) for WP4. |
